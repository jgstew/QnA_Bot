## QnA_Bot
a chat bot to do relevance evaluation

## Alexa skill - a different option

A different but related option would be to have an Amazon Alexa skill where you could ask alexa certain pre-determined queries and get the results, basically based upon existing Session Relevance queries and Analysis Property results.
